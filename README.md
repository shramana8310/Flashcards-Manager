# flashcards-manager
Flashcards manager is a Qt application that can generate a TSV-formatted flashcards file. The program will ask you to enter a list of words and specify a list of StarDict dictionaries to look them up. You can use the generated TSV file in such apps as [Flashcards Deluxe](http://flashcardsdeluxe.com/flashcards/) and [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
